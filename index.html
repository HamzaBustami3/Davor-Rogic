        <p>Right now I have trained with Davor for many years. Through his training, I have managed to improve my understanding of the game deeply. Davor is a very structured trainer, who always has good preparation for the lessons. He instructs you on how to play in every part of the game. His biggest strength as a coach is his teaching of different plans in different structures in the game. Therefore you learn how to play the game and not just to learn move orders in the opening. Also, he is a very friendly coach, who can be asked questions or tips for your training at home and how to improve more. In his lessons, he always finds a way to make even the driest topics interesting to learn. It is also amazing that Davor has such huge knowledge at almost any position. For me, he is the perfect choice as a chess teacher!</p>

        <p>Are you looking for a coach who will not only teach you the basics but is also burning to teach you everything important in chess and who is also a great person? You don't need to look any further. I've known Davor for about 20 years, playing for our club in Germany. When he was a regular tournament player, he was unbelievably strong as a player (Elo > 2600, top hundred and fifty in the world, several times participant in the Team Olympiad for Croatia) and unbelievably friendly and a humble person. Since about 15 years he has almost exclusively concentrated on his coaching activities. And what can I say? He is even much stronger as a coach than he was as a player.<br> He coaches both my children. My son has been training with Davor for about 6 years and has now reached a playing strength > Elo 2200 at the age of 21.<br> He has also been coaching my daughter since 2019, and the successes have not been long in coming. He led my daughter to the vice-championship at the German Girls' Under 14 Championships in 2019 and to the championship title Girls under 16 in 2021.<br> What I find most remarkable in all of this is the fact that he is burning for his students. In 2019, my daughter was allowed to participate in the Youth World Cup in India. Because of the time difference between India and Croatia, there were only two ways that he could prepare my daughter. Either in the evening at 20:00 Croatian time (22:30 Indian time) or in the morning 5:00 Croatian time (07:30 Indian time), sometimes even at 4:00 in the morning!!! Here he immediately suggested that training in the evening after a hard day of play would not be good. So he scheduled the training at an incredibly early time for him. Although he was very tired himself, he did a great job with the training. That's what I mean when I say that he burns for his students. He supports his players wherever he can. If you are looking for a good trainer, there are certainly many. But if you are looking for an outstanding coach, Davor is certainly the right choice.</p>

        <p>I have been working with Davor now for the last 9 months and I have really enjoyed it. He first started by getting rid of my somewhat suspicious repertoire with Nf3 with white and the Scandinavian with black against 1.e4. He told me that he will teach me “real chess”, and that is what he has done. Today I am a 1.e4 player and a 1…e5 player. I feel like I am usually very well prepared against most openings. This change in my repertoire helped me learn about different types of positions and has improved my understanding of the game a lot. Davor is very well structured in his approach. He is always, ALWAYS on time! He always sends me what we have learned within minutes of completing each lesson. Although he is a GM, he is able to understand the flaws of my game and communicate clearly where I can and should improve. He has emphasized the importance of studying chess for at least 5-10 hours a week plus playing at least 50 classical games a year if I am really serious about improvement. Davor’s competence as a coach is evidenced by the fact that he has produced junior national champions in both his home country of Croatia and in Germany. I had once the pleasure of competing in the same tournament as him (where he was fighting for the top spots and I was fighting for the bottom ones! :) ) and he was kind enough to prepare me for every opponent before every game. That was the first time I learned how professionals prepare for their games - a truly amazing experience. Aside from being a very competent coach, Davor is just an amazing human being. Very honest, with a high moral standard, who truly cares deeply about every single one of his students. I cannot recommend him highly enough.</p>

        <p>I have been working with Davor for just over 2 months and I am very happy with his coaching style, my improvement, and the value Davor offers. In the first lesson, Davor assigned me a set text to study to improve my chess and has insisted each lesson on the importance of studying to improve. Davor is honest and practical about the reality of what it takes to get better – hard work! I have struggled with a desire to play more than study, however, Davor has not indulged me into thinking this is enough. Davor has also shown me how to use ChessBase effectively in order to analyze my games and given me tools to help focus my self-study. In our lessons, we analyze my games and this is a great feeling because if and when I lose a game and I’m not sure how and why it happened, Davor is able to explain to me and breakdown that game thoroughly. Davor is extremely efficient with sending me materials from our lessons and communicating quickly if I have any questions. Davor really is extremely supportive and I feel he cares about me getting better at chess beyond our 2-hour lesson. Davor’s approach is very logical, practical, and has helped me think clearly about chess and my decision making. Before working with Davor, I simply thought about the next move and now Davor has helped me think about ‘plans’ and ‘strategy’ and ‘motifs’, I have more confidence playing and my modest beginner rating is slowly creeping up. I would strongly recommend Davor to adult beginners like me, as his approach has worked very well for me and I am extremely happy with the chess lessons and approach; I could not have asked for more! Thank you, Davor.</p>

      <p>Davor trained me excellently in each variation or aspect I required. Much better recommendations than the books I have seen and wasted money on. Very good with sending full details after each session to review again and remind me of the details of the session. Very Good value.</p>

      <p>My daughter has taken lessons from GM Davor for over 3 months. Based on the analysis of the games, class mainly focuses on the opening and endgame. Material is explained in a crystal clear way that is easy to be understood and I can immediately see the previous weakness fixed from online games. Mr. Rogic also spends a lot of time providing continuous support for my daughter in the regular time. Questions are usually answered in the email within one day.
      Mr. Rogic has great passion and patience in teaching the child. He always double checks the material illustrated before and will explain in details again if my daughter does not catch the point in the following sessions. He ensures my daughter digests all the knowledge in the proper way. This is extremely rare for a teacher to put huge responsibility on himself for a child success.
      We are so lucky to have Mr. Rogic as our coach.</p>

    <p>I and a CM titled player with peak regular rating at 2100+ in USCF (United States Chess Federation). It's been a long time for me since I stopped thinking about make any progress in chess. But since 2020, I began to study chess regularly and look forward to improve in the game, and at the end of 2021, I eventually decided to look for a strong coach to help me. And here on lichess I'm so glad that I find Coach GM Rogic!<br>
      For the past 3 months, I took weekly chess lessons from GM Rogic. Mr.Rogic is a friendly instructive coach. He carefully helps me to analyze my opening repertoire and variation choices by using his expertise and latest database suggestions. He is capable to quickly discover my playing strength and weak aspects of my play based on my OTB and online games. In addition, based on my training goal, Mr.Rogic send me lots of study materials alike books and database organized by himself.<br>
      The only small problem I occasionally meet when I take lessons from GM Rogic is language. I speak natural American English, and Mr.Rogic is actually quite fluent in speaking and writing English as someone whose first language has always been Croatian, but occasionally I was not able to undertsand him due to different habits of vocabulary options and tones. Nonetheless, with a bit of extra explaining words from both of us, we communicate totally fine in the lessons.<br>
      Mr.Rogic not only provide instructive chess lessons for me, but also share many interesting chess stories and experiences he went through. Moreover, he always rapidly replies to my questions regarding training and theories. As you will be able to see, Mr.Rogic is constantly actively online on lichess, skype, and all online communication platforms to be ready to answer his students' question in great details!<br>
      Above all, I would say GM Rogic really is the most insturctive and generous coach I've had, and I think he is absolutely one of the best coaches you can find on lichess!

        <p>Davor is an amazing coach. I've been working with Davor for more than 6 months and I've enjoyed every single lesson.<br>
          I've mostly used YouTube as a learning resource, but nothing can replace a personalised insight into your game by an experienced coach.<br>      
          I highly recommend Davor to anyone who is serious about their chess improvement.<br>

      <p>Background: I'm about 50 years old, with a full-time job and am definitely not blessed with natural chess skill. I reached out to GM Rogic for lessons after about 6 months of playing online and trying to improve (yes, I am another person who watched "The Queen's Gambit") and have been working with him for over a year. At the time I was (am?) very much a novice player.<br>

        Davor focuses on chess strategy, not short-term tactics and that has been extremely educational. The first thing I learned that I wasn't really losing games because "my opponent found a tactic". Instead, I was not developing my pieces, positioning them poorly, wasting time with useless moves, making bad trades, or choosing bad attacking plans . These poor strategic choices would leading to positions where falling victim to a tactic was basically inevitable. On the other hand, I found that if I managed to develop my pieces, position them well, make purposeful moves, and choose reasonable attacking plans I started winning a lot more games and the tactics would be in my favor. Davor's approach of emphasizing "simple chess", not complex ideas and deep calculation makes the game accessible and learnable. I'm not going to threaten any master-level players with these concepts, but they are extremely effective at my level of play. I would compare Davor's teaching style in this area to the way Daniel Naroditsky explains chess in his youtube videos.<br>
        
        Davor also revamped my opening repertoire.</p>
