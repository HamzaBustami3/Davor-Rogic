      <div class="contentz">
        I'm a chess trainer from Croatia (EU) who follows a classical chess approach and tries to play a clever, patient, logical game from the opening till the endgame. I've been playing chess for almost 40 years now, so I have gained lots of experience.<br><br>
        Engineer of electronics with a full-time job as a programming developer analyst in a bank corporation.<br><br>
        My best advice to improve your chess skills in some major chess areas (endgame, opening lines, strategy, etc.) would be to book 10 hours, and I shall give a 50€ discount (10 hours = 350€).

       Unfortunately lichess has removed reviews for lichess coaches for concerns of fabricated reviews, so I have had to put my reviews on my website instead.

      <p> Right now I have trained with Davor for many years. Through his training, I have managed to improve my understanding of the game deeply. Davor is a very structured trainer, who has always a good preparation for the lessons. He instructs you on how to play in every part of the game. His biggest strength as a coach is his teaching of different plans in different structures in the game. Therefore you learn how to play the game and not just to learn move orders in the opening. Also, he is a very friendly coach, who can be asked questions or tips for your own training at home and how to improve more. In his lessons, he always finds a way to make even the driest topics interesting to learn. It is also amazing that Davor has such huge knowledge at almost any position. For me, he is the perfect choice as a chess teacher!</p>
