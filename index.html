      <div class="contentz">
        I'm a chess trainer from Croatia (EU) who follows a classical chess approach and tries to play a clever, patient, logical game from the opening till the endgame. I've been playing chess for almost 40 years now, so I have gained lots of experience.<br><br>
        Engineer of electronics with a full-time job as a programming developer analyst in a bank corporation.<br><br>
        My best advice to improve your chess skills in some major chess areas (endgame, opening lines, strategy, etc.) would be to book 10 hours, and I shall give a 50€ discount (10 hours = 350€).

        My general target as a chess trainer is to improve the chess playing strength of my students and teach them how to play a game like a logical continuation from opening through middlegame till the endgame. Mainly, it is fundamental in classical chess education.

        I have a deep individual approach for every student and provide a lot of materials for individual work. Also, I have very good knowledge of 1.e4 move like a White and 1...d5 and 1...e5 like a Black, which I played almost all of my chess career.

      <span class="username">John Doe:</span><p> Right now i have trained with Davor for many years. Trough his training i have managed to improve
        my understanding oft he game deeply. Davor is a very structured trainer, who has always a good
        preparation for the lessons. He instructs you on how to play in every part of the game. His biggest
        stregth as a coach is his teaching of different plans in different structures in the game. Therefore you
        learn how to play the game and not just to learn move orders in the opening. Also he is a very
        friendly coach, who can be asked questions or tipps for your own training at home and how to
        improve more. In his lessons he always finds a way to make even the dryest topics interessting to
        learn. It is also amazing that Davor has such a huge knowlege at almost any position. For me he is
        the perfect choice as a chess teacher!</p>
