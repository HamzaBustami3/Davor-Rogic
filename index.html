      <div class="section-content">
        I'm a chess trainer from Croatia (EU) who follows a classical chess approach and tries to play a clever, patient, logical game from the opening till the endgame. I've been playing chess for almost 40 years now, so I have gained lots of experience.<br><br>
        Engineer of electronics with a full-time job as a programming developer analyst in a bank corporation.<br><br>
        My best advice to improve your chess skills in some major chess areas (endgame, opening lines, strategy, etc.) would be to book 10 hours, and I shall give a 50€ discount (10 hours = 350€).
